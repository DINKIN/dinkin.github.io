---

## 4. RECORDS REQUESTED — BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE

## 5. FEE STATUS & WAIVER REQUEST

- [ ] I agree to pay reasonable fees up to $[Amount, e.g., 50]. Please notify me before exceeding this amount.  
- [ ] I request a **fee waiver** under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) because disclosure is in the public interest and not primarily for commercial use. This information will shed light on government operations and activities, and its release is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government conduct.  
- [ ] I qualify as a **representative of the news media** / **educational institution** / **non-commercial scientific institution** — please waive all fees.  
- [ ] I am requesting only records that can be provided with **no or minimal fees** (e.g., under 2 hrs search time, electronic records).

> 📚 *Support fee waiver with: (1) Public interest explanation, (2) Your credentials (e.g., “I am an investigative journalist”), (3) How results will be disseminated (e.g., “published on public website”).*

---

## 6. EXPEDITED PROCESSING REQUEST (IF APPLICABLE)

- [ ] I request **expedited processing** under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E) because:  
 - [ ] Failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  
 - [ ] I am primarily engaged in disseminating information (e.g., journalist), and there is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged federal government activity.

> ⏱️ *You must certify that the statement is true and provide supporting explanation. Expedited requests must be decided within 10 calendar days.*

---

## 7. CONFIDENTIALITY & REDACTION INSTRUCTIONS

- [ ] Please **redact only what is legally exempt** — do not withhold entire documents if only portions are exempt.  
- [ ] Provide a **redaction log** describing each withheld portion and citing specific FOIA exemption(s).  
- [ ] Do **not redact names/titles of government officials** acting in official capacity unless legally required.  
- [ ] I do **not consent to broad or categorical redactions** — each redaction must be justified individually.  
- [ ] If any records are withheld in full, provide a **Vaughn Index** (detailed index describing each document, reason for withholding, and exemption claimed).

> 🛡️ *Agencies often over-redact. Explicitly demanding justification increases accountability.*

---

## 8. CERTIFICATION & SUBMISSION

I certify that the statements in this request are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. I understand that making false statements may subject me to penalties under applicable law.

**Submitted on**: `[Date]`

**Signature (if mailing/faxing)**:  
`_________________________`  
`[Your Typed Name]`

---

## 9. DELIVERY & TRACKING

- [ ] Please send records via:  
 - [ ] Email (preferred)  
 - [ ] Secure Portal / Cloud Link (e.g., Dropbox, SFTP)  
 - [ ] USPS / Certified Mail (if physical)  
- [ ] Notify me of any delays or issues via email or phone.

> 📬 *Always request an acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking/reference number.*

---

## 10. APPEAL RIGHTS & DEADLINES (INCLUDE FOR COMPLETENESS)

> ⚖️ *Even if you don’t expect denial, including this reminds the agency of its obligations.*

If any portion of this request is denied, I demand a detailed explanation citing specific statutory exemptions. I reserve the right to administratively appeal any denial, redaction, delay, or fee assessment within the time limits prescribed by law (typically 90 days for federal FOIA appeals).

**Appeals should be sent to**:  
`[Agency FOIA Appeals Office Address – find on agency FOIA page]`

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS FOR YOU:

1. **Customize** all bracketed `[ ]` sections.
2. **Verify** correct agency, address, and submission method.
3. **Save a copy** for your records.
4. **Send via traceable method** (email with read receipt, certified mail).
5. **Set calendar reminders**:
   - Federal FOIA: 20 business days to respond (may be extended)
   - State FOIL: Varies (e.g., NY = 5 business days to acknowledge, 20 to respond)
6. **Follow up** if no acknowledgment in 5–7 days.
7. **Appeal** if denied, delayed, or inadequately fulfilled.

---

## 🧭 STRATEGIC TIPS TO MAXIMIZE SUCCESS

- **Split large requests** into smaller ones to avoid “unduly burdensome” rejections.
- **Request search terms/logs** — sometimes you can get the agency’s own search methodology.
- **Ask for “all records responsive to this description, including those in possession of contractors or third parties acting on the agency’s behalf.”**
- **Cite recent similar releases** (e.g., “Similar records were released to [Name] on [Date] under FOIA #XYZ — see attached”) to prevent “novelty” objections.
- **Submit to multiple offices** if unsure — e.g., both Central FOIA Office and specific Bureau/Division.
- **Use MuckRock (muckrock.com)** or **FOIA Machine** to file, track, and publish requests.

## ✍️ SECTION 1: YOUR INFORMATION (REQUESTER)

> 💡 **Why this matters**: Agencies must respond to a “person” under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3). You don’t need to justify *why* you want records — only *who* you are.

- **Name**: `[Jane Doe]`  
  → *Example: “John Smith” or “ACLU of Southern California”*  
  → *Tip: Use legal name for paper mail; org name if representing entity*

- **Address**: `[123 Main St, Apt 4B, New York, NY 10001]`  
  → *Required for certified mail or paper responses. Use P.O. Box for anonymity if allowed by state law.*

- **Phone**: `[(555) 123-4567]`  
  → *Optional but helpful for urgent clarification*

- **Email**: `[jane.doe@email.com]`  
  → *STRATEGIC PHRASING: “Please send all correspondence, updates, and records to this email address.”*

- **Organization (optional)**: `[Investigative Journalist, The City Watch]`  
  → *CRITICAL FOR FEE WAIVER: If you’re media/education/nonprofit, state it here to trigger mandatory fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)*

> 🛡️ **Legal Citation**: 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3) — “Each agency shall make available to any person…”  
> 🚫 **Never say**: “I need this for a lawsuit” — can trigger exemptions. Say: “For public interest reporting.”

---

## 🏛️ SECTION 2: AGENCY / OFFICE INFORMATION

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Submit to BOTH central FOIA office AND the specific bureau/division that holds the records. Increases chance of success.

- **Agency Name**: `[New York City Police Department]`  
  → *Example: “U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE” or “California Department of Justice”*

- **FOIA Officer (if known)**: `[John Rodriguez, FOIA Public Liaison]`  
  → *Find on agency FOIA page. Personalizing increases response rate.*

- **Mailing Address**: `[NYPD FOIA Unit, 1 Police Plaza, Room 606, New York, NY 10038]`  
  → *VERIFY: Some agencies reject requests sent to wrong address. Check foia.gov or agency site.*

- **Email (if accepted)**: `[NYPDFOIA@nyc.gov]`  
  → *STRATEGIC PHRASING: “I request electronic acknowledgment of receipt within 5 business days per 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(f).”*

- **Fax (if accepted)**: `[(555) 987-6543]`  
  → *Rarely used now — confirm if still accepted.*

> ⚖️ **Procedural Reminder**: Federal agencies must acknowledge within 10 days (5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i)). States vary — NY FOIL: 5 business days.

---

## ⚖️ SECTION 3: REQUEST TYPE & LEGAL BASIS

> 💡 **CHECK ALL THAT APPLY** — agencies often subject to multiple laws.

- [x] **Federal FOIA** — 5 U.S.C. § 552  
  → *Applies to all federal executive agencies. Not Congress or Courts.*

- [ ] **NY FOIL** — N.Y. Pub. Off. Law § 84 et seq.  
  → *Example: Requesting from NYPD, NYC DOE, State agencies*

- [ ] **CA CPRA** — Cal. Gov. Code § 6250 et seq.  
  → *Stronger than FOIA in some ways — e.g., 10-day response window*

- [ ] **Other State Law**: `[Texas Public Information Act, Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.001]`  
  → *Always cite the statute — forces legal compliance*

- [ ] **Local Ordinance**: `[Chicago Municipal Code § 2-56]`  
  → *Many cities have their own laws — often faster and broader*

> 🧠 **Best Practice**: If unsure, cite both federal and state. Example:  
> *“This request is made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552 and N.Y. Pub. Off. Law § 87(1).”*

## 📂 SECTION 4: RECORDS REQUESTED — THE HEART OF YOUR REQUEST

> 💥 **MOST IMPORTANT SECTION** — specificity = success. Vagueness = denial.

### A. SUBJECT DETAILS — BE PRECISE

- **Topic/Project**: `[All body-worn camera footage of Officer ID #12345 during arrest of John Smith on March 15, 2024, at 11:30 PM near 5th Ave & 42nd St, Manhattan]`  
  → *BAD: “All NYPD body cam footage” → TOO BROAD → DENIED*  
  → *GOOD: Specific officer, date, time, location, incident*

- **Persons/Entities**: `[Officer ID #12345, John Smith (arrestee), Sergeant Maria Lopez (supervisor)]`  
  → *Include badge numbers, case IDs, project codes*

- **Location**: `[5th Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets, Manhattan, NY 10018]`  
  → *GPS coordinates if possible: “40.7580° N, 73.9855° W”*

- **Time Frame**: `[March 15, 2024, 11:00 PM to March 16, 2024, 12:30 AM]`  
  → *Narrow windows = faster, cheaper, higher compliance*

> 🎯 **Strategic Phrasing**:  
> *“Include all drafts, edits, versions, and attachments. Include metadata, file properties, and system logs associated with these records.”*

### B. RECORD TYPES — CHECK ALL THAT APPLY WITH EXAMPLES

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Request “search methodology” — forces them to document how they looked.

- [x] Emails / Correspondence  
  → *Example: “All emails between Deputy Chief X and Mayor’s Office re: protest policy Jan 1–31, 2024”*

- [x] Memos / Briefings / Reports  
  → *Example: “After-Action Report re: Jan 6 Capitol Response, including all drafts”*

  → *Example: “Minutes of ICE Enforcement Priorities Meeting, Feb 2024”*

- [x] Contracts / Grants / Invoices

  → *Example: “Current NYPD Patrol Guide Chapter 12: Use of Force, including revision history”*

- [x] Training Materials / Slides  
  → *Example: “All PowerPoint slides used in 2023 ‘Crowd Control’ training for LAPD”*

- [x] Surveillance / Body Cam / Dash Cam  
  → *CRITICAL: Specify exact time, location, officer ID. “All body cam from Officer #7890, March 15, 2024, 11:30 PM–12:15 AM, 5th Ave & 42nd St”*

- [x] Databases / Spreadsheets  
  → *Example: “Excel file ‘2023_Arrests.xlsx’, columns: Date, Charge, Officer ID, Location, Disposition”*

- [x] Audit / Inspection Reports  
  → *Example: “OIG Report #2024-01: Inspection of CBP Facility at San Ysidro Port of Entry”*

- [x] Complaints / Investigations  
  → *Example: “All internal affairs complaints against Officer #12345, 2020–2024, with redactions only for personal info per exemption (b)(6)”*

> 🛡️ **Redaction Strategy**: Preemptively cite exemptions they *can* use — shows you know the law and limits over-redaction.

### C. FORMAT & DELIVERY — FORCE ELECTRONIC

- [x] PDF (searchable, OCR if scanned)  
- [x] Native (.docx, .xlsx) — *Preserves metadata and formulas*  
- [x] CSV / JSON — *For data analysis*  
- [x] MP4 — *For video*  
- [ ] Paper Copies — *Avoid — slow, expensive, no searchability*

> 💡 **Strategic Phrasing**:  
> *“Provide in native, machine-readable format. Do not convert spreadsheets to PDF — this destroys usability and violates spirit of FOIA.”*

> 🚫 **Never accept**: “We can only provide paper.” → Respond: “Per DOJ FOIA Guidelines, electronic format is preferred and required if it exists.”

---

## 💰 SECTION 5: FEE STATUS — WAIVE OR CAP

> 💡 **Fee Waiver is your RIGHT if you’re media/education/nonprofit**

- [ ] I agree to pay fees up to $`[50]`  
  → *STRATEGIC: Set low cap ($20–$50). Forces them to contact you before charging.*

- [x] I request a **fee waiver** because:  
  → *“Disclosure is in public interest, not commercial. I am a journalist. Release will inform public about police accountability.”*  
  → *Cite: 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) — fee waived if “disclosure likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations.”*

- [x] I qualify as:  
  - [x] News Media — *Attach masthead or publication URL*  
  - [ ] Educational Institution  
  - [ ] Non-commercial Scientific Org

> 📜 **Legal Citation**: DOJ FOIA Fee Waiver Guidelines — https://www.justice.gov/oip/fee-waiver-guidelines

---

## ⚡ SECTION 6: EXPEDITED PROCESSING — WHEN TO USE

> 💡 Only if TRUE — false claims can backfire.

- [x] I request expedited processing because:  
  - [ ] Imminent threat to life/safety — *e.g., “Chemical plant leak data — public at risk”*  
  - [x] Urgent public interest — *“I am journalist with deadline on police brutality story — public needs info before City Council vote.”*

> ⚖️ **Legal Standard**: 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E) — must show “compelling need.”  
> 📅 **Deadline**: Agency must respond to expedited request within 10 calendar days.

---

## 🛡️ SECTION 7: REDACTION INSTRUCTIONS — LIMIT OVER-REDACTION

> 💥 **MOST POWERFUL SECTION** — forces accountability.

- [x] Redact only legally exempt portions — cite exemption for each.  
- [x] Provide redaction log — *“Describe each redaction: Page #, Line #, Exemption (e.g., b(7)(C)), Reason”*  
- [x] Do NOT redact government officials’ names/titles — *“Names of public employees acting in official capacity are not exempt under (b)(6).”*  
- [x] No broad redactions — *“Do not redact entire pages — only specific words or lines.”*  
- [x] If withholding entire doc, provide Vaughn Index — *“List each document: Date, Author, Subject, Exemption, Reason”*

> 📚 **Legal Citation**: *Meeropol v. Meese*, 790 F.2d 942 (D.C. Cir. 1986) — agencies must justify each redaction.

---

## ✍️ SECTION 8: CERTIFICATION

> ⚖️ **Not legally required but adds weight.**

- **Date**: `[April 5, 2025]`
- **Signature**: _________________________
- **Typed Name**: `[Jane Doe]`

2. Specific exemption for each (e.g., ‘b(7)(C)’)
