## 4. RECORDS REQUESTED — BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE

## 5. FEE STATUS & WAIVER REQUEST

- [ ] I agree to pay reasonable fees up to $[Amount, e.g., 50]. Please notify me before exceeding this amount.  
- [ ] I request a **fee waiver** under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) because disclosure is in the public interest and not primarily for commercial use. This information will shed light on government operations and activities, and its release is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government conduct.  
- [ ] I qualify as a **representative of the news media** / **educational institution** / **non-commercial scientific institution** — please waive all fees.  
- [ ] I am requesting only records that can be provided with **no or minimal fees** (e.g., under 2 hrs search time, electronic records).

> 📚 *Support fee waiver with: (1) Public interest explanation, (2) Your credentials (e.g., “I am an investigative journalist”), (3) How results will be disseminated (e.g., “published on public website”).*

---

## 6. EXPEDITED PROCESSING REQUEST (IF APPLICABLE)

- [ ] I request **expedited processing** under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E) because:  
 - [ ] Failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  
 - [ ] I am primarily engaged in disseminating information (e.g., journalist), and there is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged federal government activity.

> ⏱️ *You must certify that the statement is true and provide supporting explanation. Expedited requests must be decided within 10 calendar days.*

---

## 7. CONFIDENTIALITY & REDACTION INSTRUCTIONS

- [ ] Please **redact only what is legally exempt** — do not withhold entire documents if only portions are exempt.  
- [ ] Provide a **redaction log** describing each withheld portion and citing specific FOIA exemption(s).  
- [ ] Do **not redact names/titles of government officials** acting in official capacity unless legally required.  
- [ ] I do **not consent to broad or categorical redactions** — each redaction must be justified individually.  
- [ ] If any records are withheld in full, provide a **Vaughn Index** (detailed index describing each document, reason for withholding, and exemption claimed).

> 🛡️ *Agencies often over-redact. Explicitly demanding justification increases accountability.*

---

## 8. CERTIFICATION & SUBMISSION

I certify that the statements in this request are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. I understand that making false statements may subject me to penalties under applicable law.

**Submitted on**: `[Date]`

**Signature (if mailing/faxing)**:  
`_________________________`

## 9. DELIVERY & TRACKING

 - [ ] Email (preferred)  
 - [ ] Secure Portal / Cloud Link (e.g., Dropbox, SFTP)

- [ ] Notify me of any delays or issues via email or phone.

> 📬 *Always request an acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking/reference number.*

---

## 10. APPEAL RIGHTS & DEADLINES (INCLUDE FOR COMPLETENESS)

> ⚖️ *Even if you don’t expect denial, including this reminds the agency of its obligations.*

If any portion of this request is denied, I demand a detailed explanation citing specific statutory exemptions. I reserve the right to administratively appeal any denial, redaction, delay, or fee assessment within the time limits prescribed by law (typically 90 days for federal FOIA appeals).

**Appeals should be sent to**:  
`[Agency FOIA Appeals Office Address – find on agency FOIA page]`

## ✅ NEXT STEPS FOR YOU:

1. **Customize** all bracketed `[ ]` sections.
2. **Verify** correct agency, address, and submission method.
3. **Save a copy** for your records.
4. **Send via traceable method** (email with read receipt, certified mail).
5. **Set calendar reminders**:
   - Federal FOIA: 20 business days to respond (may be extended)
   - State FOIL: Varies (e.g., NY = 5 business days to acknowledge, 20 to respond)
6. **Follow up** if no acknowledgment in 5–7 days.
7. **Appeal** if denied, delayed, or inadequately fulfilled.

## 🧭 STRATEGIC TIPS TO MAXIMIZE SUCCESS

- **Split large requests** into smaller ones to avoid “unduly burdensome” rejections.
- **Request search terms/logs** — sometimes you can get the agency’s own search methodology.
- **Ask for “all records responsive to this description, including those in possession of contractors or third parties acting on the agency’s behalf.”**
- **Cite recent similar releases** (e.g., “Similar records were released to [Name] on [Date] under FOIA #XYZ — see attached”) to prevent “novelty” objections.
- **Submit to multiple offices** if unsure — e.g., both Central FOIA Office and specific Bureau/Division.
- **Use MuckRock (muckrock.com)** or **FOIA Machine** to file, track, and publish requests.
